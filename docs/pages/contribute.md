# How to support VersaTiles?

We need â€¦

- more examples on how to use MapLibre as a frontend in the [documentation](https://docs.versatiles.org/) (in HTML/JavaScript),
- a Docker container with VersaTiles, NGINX, Let's Encrypt (as Docker, [Repo](https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-docker), [Issue](https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-docker/issues/5)),
- fixes, so the VersaTiles server runs on Windows (in Rust, [Repo](https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-rs), [Issue](https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-rs/issues/31)),
- a way to install VersaTiles on NixOs, and also via Flatpak and snap,
- a good solution to improve the lower zoom levels (< 8 or so). They are quite empty. Maybe we need something like a vegetation layer? ([Issue](https://github.com/versatiles-org/versatiles-generator/issues/2)),

Please help us to improve the [documentation](https://docs.versatiles.org/).
